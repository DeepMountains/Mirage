# Vulnerability

FileUpload

# Description

On the "admin/file_manage_control.php" page, image files can be uploaded. Due to the lack of restrictions on file extensions like "phtml" and ".htaccess" in the filtering rules, an attacker can upload a phtml file containing malicious code to execute arbitrary code.

# Analysis

1. It can be seen that in the filtering rules, sensitive files such as phtml and .htaccess are not prohibited from uploading.

2. When uploading a file, you need to modify the file extension and add a GIF89a file header.

# Note
A similar vulnerability also exists in the rename method within "admin/file_manage_control.php", where an image file containing PHP code can be uploaded and then renamed to a .phtml file.
