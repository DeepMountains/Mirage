# Description

In the backend of innocms, you can edit templates for pages like products and about on the "/panel/pages/1/edit" page. These templates allow the execution of functions like system to run system commands, and they can also execute PHP code. This is very dangerous and should not be allowed.

# Analysis

Through analysis, it can be found that the content of the template will be stored in the "icms_dege_translations" table of the database. At the same time, when users access the corresponding page and modify the corresponding page template, the content of the corresponding template will be extracted and written in the "/var/www/html/storage/framework/views" position. You can see that the suffixes of these files are all PHP, which causes the PHP code in the template to be parsed.
