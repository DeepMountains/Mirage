# Vulnerability

Arbitrary File Download

# Description

In the /admin/file_manager/export interface function, since there is no filtering mechanism, attackers can construct a directory traversal POC to download any file on the host.

# Analysis
1. Through the website path, it is found that the implementation of the /admin/file_manager/export interface function is located in the exportZip method of beike/Admin/Http/Controllers/FileManagerController.php. This function is mainly used to package and download the target directory.

2. By tracing the method of beike/Admin/Services/FileManagerService.php -> zipFolder(), it can be found that the page does not filter the incoming path, allowing attackers to construct a special POC to download any file.
