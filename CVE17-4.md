# Vulnerability

FileUpload

# Description

An attacker can modify the settings on the admin configuration page to allow the upload of images with the .phtml extension. Then, they can upload a malicious .phtml file through the "/admin/dialog/select_images_post.php" page.

# Analysis

1. In the admin panel, under "System Settings" -> "Attachment Settings," the .phtml extension can be added to the list of allowed image upload extensions. This is because the "/admin/dialog/select_images_post.php" page first checks the allowed file extensions defined in the config.php file.

2. Subsequently, in the get_mime_type function, the file extensions like .php and .php3 are checked, but .phtml is not. Therefore, the added extension must be .phtml to bypass these checks.

3. When uploading a file, you need to modify the file extension and add a GIF89a file header. Although the server's response code is 500, the file has been successfully uploaded.

# Note
The same issue exists on the "admin/dialog/select_soft_post.php" page, where it primarily allows bypassing upload restrictions for multimedia and software files.
