# Description

In ltcms, there is an API endpoint "api/file/multiDownload" that can be used to download files from a remote server and save them to the website directory without requiring authentication. 

# Analysis

By examining the api.php file, it is found that the corresponding method is located in the "File/multiDownload" controller. By tracing further, the specific implementation code can be found in "app/utils/base/helper/Ltcms_download.php". The multiDownload method uses curl_exec() to request the content from the URL specified in the file parameter and saves the content to the location specified by the savePath parameter using file_put_contents.

In the app/client/api/C_file.php file, it is found that multiDownload requires parameters to be passed via the GET method.
