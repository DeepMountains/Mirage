# Vulnerabilities

SSRF

# Description

In ltcms, there is an API endpoint "api/file/downloadUrl" that can be used to perform a blind SSRF attack. The corresponding page for this endpoint is located in "app/utils/base/helper/Ltcms_download.php". This endpoint does not require authentication, allowing anyone to call curl_exec() to request a URL specified in the url parameter. Additionally, due to the lack of protocol filtering, protocols like file, dict, etc., can be used to initiate requests to the internal network.
