# Vulnerabilities

Arbitrary File Read

# Description

In ltcms, there is an API endpoint "api/file/downloadFile" that can be used to read arbitrary files and no authentication is required. By examining the api.php file, it is found that the corresponding method is located in "File/downloadFile". By tracing further, the specific implementation code can be found in "app/utils/base/helper/Ltcms_download.php". In the implementation of the downloadFile function, fopen reads the content of the file specified in the file parameter and subsequently outputs the read result based on certain conditions.
