# Vulnerability

FileUpload

# Description

On the "admin/media_add.php" page, image files can be uploaded. Due to the lack of restrictions on file extensions like "phtml" and ".htaccess" in the filtering rules, an attacker can upload a phtml file containing malicious code to execute arbitrary code.

# Analysis

1. It can be seen that in the filtering rules, sensitive files such as phtml and .htaccess are not prohibited from uploading.

2. When uploading a file, you need to modify the file extension and add a GIF89a file header. Although the server's response code is 500, the file has been successfully uploaded.

3. Although the saved file name is random and the upload location is not disclosed in the response package, the website has a built-in file management feature that allows you to directly view the list of uploaded files.
