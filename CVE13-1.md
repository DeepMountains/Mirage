# Description

In this site, the validation interface used for file uploads has insufficient filtering, allowing attackers to easily bypass it and upload PHP files.

# Analysis

When uploading an image on this site, the designated site interface is "/user/save," which corresponds to the "HomeController@postUser" controller. Analyzing the postUser method in "app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php," it is found that the site uses Laravel's validation function "$this->validate" to apply the image rule to the uploaded content. The image rule primarily checks if the MIME type of the uploaded file is a common image format (such as jpeg, png, bmp, gif, svg, etc.). This allows an attacker to upload a PHP file simply by modifying the Content-Type field to image/jpeg and add GIF89a to the file header.
