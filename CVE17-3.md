# Vulnerability

FileUpload

# Description

In the "admin/archives_do.php" page, when the dopost parameter is set to "uploadLitpic," there is a file upload vulnerability that allows attackers to upload .phtml files, bypassing the detection rules.

# Analysis

1. On the "admin/archives_do.php" page, when the dopost value is set to uploadLitpic, the AdminUpload function is triggered to handle file uploads.
2. The AdminUpload function is defined in "system/helpers/upload.helper.php". In this function, only the file type is checked, allowing an attacker to bypass detection by modifying the file type and header in the data packet, thus directly uploading a PHP file.
